<h2>Project Description:</h2>
<p>
  The website primarily focuses on controlling the chaos inside the college campus. It helps the college authority to maintain discipline and manage students in college in an easy way by providing an all-in-one platform for managing all kinds of activities related to students and colleges inside the college campuses. It also helps in managing college in pandemic situations like COVID by not allowing many students to gather at one place.
Challenges we ran into
We faced problems in linking all models between students and staff and making it easy to understand and to grant permission.
It was very difficult to manage this much data and to connect and interlink every piece of information with each other.
Time management was also a big deal for us.
